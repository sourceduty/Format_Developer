<br>

### Hybrid Encryption Communication Format

**Overview**: This format combines the strengths of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is used to securely exchange a symmetric key, which is then used to encrypt the actual message.

#### Components:

1. **Asymmetric Encryption**:
   - Algorithm: RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
   - Key Size: 2048 bits
   - Used for: Secure key exchange

2. **Symmetric Encryption**:
   - Algorithm: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
   - Key Size: 256 bits
   - Used for: Message encryption

3. **Message Structure**:
   - **Header**: Contains metadata about the message, including version, timestamp, and the encrypted symmetric key.
   - **Body**: The actual encrypted message data.
   - **Signature**: Optional, provides integrity and authenticity.

### Detailed Format:

#### 1. **Header**:

- **Version (2 bytes)**: Identifies the version of the encryption format.
- **Timestamp (8 bytes)**: UNIX timestamp indicating when the message was created.
- **Sender ID (Variable)**: Unique identifier for the sender (e.g., public key fingerprint).
- **Encrypted Symmetric Key (256 bytes)**: The AES key encrypted using the recipient's RSA public key.

#### 2. **Body**:

- **IV (Initialization Vector) (16 bytes)**: Randomly generated for each message, used with AES encryption.
- **Encrypted Data (Variable)**: The actual message data encrypted using the AES symmetric key.

#### 3. **Signature (Optional)**:

- **Signature (Variable)**: The message body signed with the sender's RSA private key, ensuring integrity and authenticity.

### Message Flow Example:

1. **Message Creation**:
   - The sender generates a 256-bit AES symmetric key.
   - The sender encrypts the AES key using the recipient's RSA public key.
   - The sender encrypts the message body using AES encryption with the generated key.
   - The sender creates a message header, including metadata and the encrypted AES key.
   - Optionally, the sender signs the message body using their RSA private key.

2. **Message Transmission**:
   - The complete message, including header, body, and optional signature, is transmitted to the recipient.

3. **Message Decryption**:
   - The recipient extracts the encrypted AES key from the header and decrypts it using their RSA private key.
   - The recipient uses the decrypted AES key to decrypt the message body.
   - Optionally, the recipient verifies the signature using the sender's public key.

### Example Message Structure (in Bytes):

```
| Header |

Version: 0x01 0x00
Timestamp: 0x5F3B5E7B
Sender ID: 0xA1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8
Encrypted AES Key: 0x123456789ABCDEF...

| Body |

IV: 0x1A2B3C4D5E6F7081
Encrypted Data: 0x9F8E7D6C5B4A3B2C...

| Signature (Optional) |

Signature: 0xABCDEF0123456789...
```

### Advantages of This Format:

- **Security**: Combines the security of RSA for key exchange with the efficiency of AES for data encryption.
- **Flexibility**: The format is adaptable and can be extended with additional metadata or security features.
- **Integrity and Authenticity**: Optional signature ensures the message has not been tampered with and verifies the sender's identity.

This format provides a solid foundation for secure communication, suitable for scenarios where both security and performance are important.

<details><summary>Unique Custom File Format Example</summary>
<br>

This is an example of a custom file format that could be used for configuring a simple web application. The format is designed to be human-readable and easily parsed by software.

File Format: .webappconfig

```
# Web Application Configuration File
# This file contains the settings for configuring the web application

[AppSettings]
AppName = MyWebApp                 # Name of the application
Version = 1.0.0                    # Version of the application
Port = 8080                        # Port on which the application will run
DebugMode = true                   # Enable or disable debug mode

[DatabaseConfig]
DBType = PostgreSQL                # Type of the database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
DBHost = localhost                 # Database host
DBPort = 5432                      # Database port
DBName = mywebapp_db               # Database name
DBUser = dbuser                    # Database user
DBPassword = dbpassword            # Database password (consider using environment variables for security)

[Logging]
LogLevel = INFO                    # Logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
LogToFile = true                   # Enable or disable logging to file
LogFilePath = /var/log/mywebapp.log # Path to the log file

[AuthSettings]
EnableAuth = true                  # Enable or disable authentication
AuthProvider = OAuth2              # Authentication provider (e.g., OAuth2, LDAP)
OAuth2ClientID = your_client_id    # OAuth2 Client ID
OAuth2ClientSecret = your_client_secret # OAuth2 Client Secret

[FeatureToggles]
EnableFeatureX = false             # Toggle for enabling Feature X
EnableBetaFeatures = true          # Toggle for enabling beta features
```

Explanation:

- Sections: The file is divided into sections, each starting with a header in square brackets, such as [AppSettings]. Each section groups related configuration settings.
- Key-Value Pairs: Within each section, configuration settings are specified as key-value pairs, using the format Key = Value.
- Comments: Lines beginning with # are comments and are ignored by the parser. They are used to provide descriptions or instructions.
- Data Types: Values are stored as strings but can represent different data types (e.g., boolean, integer) as needed by the application.

This format is simple and intuitive, making it easy for developers to configure and for the application to parse.
